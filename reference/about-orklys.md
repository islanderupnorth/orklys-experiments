**AI First**
We're revolutionising how renewable energy projects get built. Faster, simpler, and ready to compete.

**Simplicity**
Developing renewable energy projects is complex. We make it simple.

**Transparency**
We believe in open communication and clear processes. No hidden agendas.

**Equity**
We believe in renewable energy should be accessible to everyone. No matter where you are.

## Problem

Thousands of energy communities never get off the ground - blocked by complexity, funding gaps and navigating approval processes.

Despite being a cornerstone of the EU’s energy transition strategy — with the potential to supply up to 70% of national energy needs by 2050 — current funding covers only one-third of what’s required.

Today, just 2–5% of areas mandated to host an energy community under the REPowerEU plan have done so.

Permitting processes alone can take up to five times longer than necessary.

## Solution

Orklys end-to-end platform makes it easy for energy communities to plan, fund, build and run clean energy projects.
