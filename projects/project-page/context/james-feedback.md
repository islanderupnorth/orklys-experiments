# Content/Copy:

"Invest" word - can't use, needs to be configurable
Currency needs to be editable

# Layout/Structure:

Crowdfunding element - shouldn't be first thing shown before project intro
Overview section - too finance-focused, loses community/environment impact value
Statistics boxes - maybe better way to present this data
Faces/founders - include on page but not in current block format
Team info section - needed (who they're dealing with)

# AI Window:

Currently too big
Should start smaller, expand during conversation
Needs heading/indication of purpose (says it somewhat but unclear)

# Design:

Button color inconsistency (bottom vs top)
Lots of dark green - reviewer neutral but suggests possible improvement
