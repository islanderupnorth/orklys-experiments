## Section 8: FAQ

### Section Header
**Questions**

**What kind of returns can I expect?**
Projected annual returns are [X]%, based on independent analysis. Actual returns depend on project performance.

**Can I sell my share later?**
Yes. Shares can be transferred to other community members. We help facilitate the process.

**How is this different from buying energy company stock?**
You own part of an actual project in your community — not shares in a corporation. The energy is produced locally, and returns stay local.

**What happens at the end of the project's life?**
The community decides together — whether to upgrade, extend, or wind down and distribute proceeds.

**I don't understand energy or finance. Is this for me?**
We designed this to be accessible. Plain-language updates, a team you can contact, and an AI assistant to answer questions anytime.

# Design Notes

1. **Tone:** Direct, honest, no hype. Let the facts speak.

2. **Structure:** Project first → benefits → numbers → social proof → action

3. **Language:** "Co-owner" not "investor." "Returns" not "investment returns."

4. **Currency:** All amounts use `[Currency][Amount]` for flexibility

5. **Chat:** Starts collapsed. Clear, simple header when open.

6. **Visuals:** Avoid promotional-looking stat boxes. Use clean typography and whitespace.

7. **Colour:** Consider a warm accent for CTAs to contrast the green. Keep buttons consistent throughout.
