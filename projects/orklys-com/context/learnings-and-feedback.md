# Current Website Feedback

- Our main sales proposition is that Orklys helps make Energy Communities a reality and making the process easier. From navigating the regulatory complexities to planning and getting community buy-in and funding. It is important to note that we have built many tools which can be purchased as well but that is secondary and a "side product" to our main product which has been to
- Content is out of date — needs updating (tools have been built since amongst other things)
- Should condense to 3 simple points
- Values section is important — keep
- We are missing a navigation
- Missing hamburger menu (on mobile)
- Dislikes the small buttons in header
- The EnergyCalculator ("Calculate your energy needs")
- Missing a partnerships section i.e. Aarhus University, DTU etc.
- It should be possible to access each of the tools quickly. So press on a link or button and directly be taken to the experience where they can begin interacting with the i.e. legal agent (for the landing page purposes simple link to i.e. /tools/legal-assistant).
- Place the LanguageSwitcher in the footer at the bottom of the page.

# Out of scope (do not build when writing code)

- Do not create the individual tools but only refer or link to them. Their code is in my main code base and will be integrated later.
- Do not attempt to re-create the EnergyCalculator (simply have a placeholder text here indicating ENERGYCALCULATOR - Calculate Your Energy Needs)
- Values Section (simply have 5 cards not styled here with the 5 values 1:1)
- Footer legal mumbo jumbo text - just re-use current website for now
