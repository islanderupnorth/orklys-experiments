# Orklys Landing Page Copy - Draft 1

## Positioning Overview

Orklys positions itself as the warm, expert guide that transforms the complex, bureaucratic journey of building an energy community into an achievable path. The copy speaks to early-stage communities who have the vision but lack the roadmap—validating their ambition while removing the fear of complexity. The AI tools serve as proof of capability and immediate value, while the human consultation remains the primary conversion path. The tone is empowering ("you can do this") rather than salesy, reflecting the trust and transparency values.

## [Section: Problem + Agitation]

You have the land. You have the community support. You might even have a board and a budget. But between understanding regulations, finding the right technology, securing funding, and navigating permits that can drag on for years—turning your energy community dream into reality feels impossibly complex.

Most communities get stuck before they truly start. Permitting alone takes up to five times longer than it should. Funding covers only a third of what's actually needed. And without expert guidance, even the most motivated teams burn out chasing answers across fragmented resources.

You shouldn't need a law degree, an engineering background, and a finance certification just to bring clean energy to your neighbours.

Your initial consultation is free. We'll discuss project scope and options, and you'll understand costs before any commitment.

2. **Tools placement test:** Tools section above the fold (immediately after hero) vs. after Problem/Solution sections — tests whether immediate tool access increases engagement or if building context first converts better
