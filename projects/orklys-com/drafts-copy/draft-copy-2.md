# Orklys Landing Page Copy - Draft 2

## Positioning Shift

This draft leads with community empowerment and belonging—the emotional "why"—rather than technology. AI is present but positioned as "how we deliver" not "what we are." The structure flows: inspiration → problem → solution → proof → tools → action. Benefits focus on outcomes for the community (ownership, savings, resilience, local value) rather than platform features.

## [Section: The Opportunity]

**H2:** This Is Your Moment

Energy communities are reshaping how Europe powers itself. Neighbours, villages, and local organisations are coming together to own wind turbines, solar installations, and storage systems—generating clean power and real returns.

**Key Facts:**

- 7,000+ energy communities already operating across the EU
- €225 billion in EU funding available for local energy projects
- 80%+ of Europeans support community-owned energy
- Renewables are now the most economical energy source

The opportunity is here. The support is here. The only question: is your community ready?

## [Section: The Challenge]

**H2:** But Getting Started Shouldn't Be This Hard

You've got the vision. Maybe the land. Perhaps even a group of neighbours ready to act. But between regulations, permits, technology choices, and funding—the path forward feels buried in complexity.

- Permitting can take 5x longer than it should
- Available funding covers only a third of what's needed
- Most communities get stuck before they truly start

You shouldn't need to become an expert in law, finance, and engineering just to bring clean energy to your community.

**That's where we come in.**

## [Section: Success Story]

**H2:** What's Possible When Communities Lead

**Thyboron, Denmark**

In a small coastal town of 2,800 people, neighbours came together with a bold idea: build one of Europe's largest community-owned wind turbines.

They raised €22.8 million locally. Built a 15 MW turbine. And they didn't stop there—they've now completed five successful projects.

The energy they generate? It stays in Thyboron. The returns? They go to the people who live there.

This is what happens when a community decides to own its energy future.
