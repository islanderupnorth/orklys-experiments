# "How Screwed Are You?" Campaign

## Campaign Brief

**Name:** How Screwed Are You?
**Concept:** Users upload their energy bill to see how badly they're getting ripped off — then get inspired to take back control by forming an Energy Community.
**Mission:** Inspire people to demand to own their own electricity.

## Core Messaging

- Your energy company is screwing you. Here's the proof.
- Upload your bill → see your "Screwed Score" → take action
- Energy Communities let you own your electricity — and there's funding to help

## Target Audience

- Homeowners and renters in Denmark (primary) and EU (secondary)
- People who pay energy bills and suspect they're overpaying
- Community-minded people who'd rally neighbors around shared infrastructure

## Conversion Goals (Dual)

1. **Join an Energy Community** — direct action, high intent
2. **Email list capture** — "Get your free report" for nurturing

## Key Arguments

- There's funding available for Energy Communities (EU directives)
- Your community already wants this (show data/graphs of current state)
- "What's not to like?" — lower bills, local ownership, green energy

## Geography

- Denmark-first (DKK, Danish energy market context)
- EU-adaptable (EUR, EU energy community directives)

## Tone & Voice

- Bold, provocative, conversational
- NOT corporate, NOT preachy
- Think: "a friend who's genuinely outraged on your behalf"
