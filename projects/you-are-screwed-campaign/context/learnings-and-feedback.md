# Learnings & Feedback

## Review Round 1 — draft-copy-1.md

Three-agent review: Viral Mechanics, Emotional Resonance, Danish Market Fit.

### Key Findings (all three agents agreed)

1. Copy peaks at Problem section, then falls off a cliff at Solution — goes from "angry friend" to "policy explainer"
2. Screwed Score is treated as an afterthought, should be the centerpiece
3. Emotional arc breaks when Energy Communities are introduced

### Viral Mechanics Feedback

- Copy is a conversion page pretending to be a viral tool (80/20 wrong ratio)
- Need zero-friction "Quick Score" path (postcode + amount) before bill upload
- Score card needs identity tiers: "Corporate Cash Cow" (8-10), "Getting Milked" (6-8), etc.
- Need referred-friend landing page variant for viral loop
- Share should be PRIMARY CTA on score screen, not conversion
- Missing: neighborhood leaderboards, comparison hooks, challenge mechanic, re-share prompts

### Emotional Resonance Feedback

- Solution section kills momentum — lead with emotional image, not legal frameworks
- "You BECOME the provider" is the most powerful line and it's buried in a bullet
- Kill standalone "Yeah, But..." objection section — introduces doubts people didn't have
- Hero bullets describe features, should describe emotional states
- The identity shift from victim → owner needs to be the climax, not a footnote

### Danish Market Fit Feedback (CRITICAL)

- "Subsidizing shareholder dividends" is factually WRONG for Denmark — most retailers are cooperatives
- Danish energy bills are taxes + regulated grid fees + spot price — tiny retail margin
- Tone is too American — Danes are allergic to exclamation marks and false dichotomies
- MISSING: andelsbevægelsen (cooperative tradition) — this is the cultural superpower
- MISSING: Danish bill components (nettarif, elafgift, systemtarif)
- MISSING: Danish wind energy pride, varmecheck crisis context, fjernvarme
- EU directive transposition into Danish law is still partial — don't overclaim
- Renter inclusion is aspirational, not yet fully operational
- Villain should be "expensive system" not "evil company"

### Changes Applied in draft-copy-2.md

- Rewrote villain from "evil company" to "a system not designed for you"
- Rooted in andelsbevægelsen — cooperative tradition as cultural hook
- Adopted Danish dry truth-telling tone — sardonic, not shouty
- Added Quick Score path before bill upload
- Redesigned Score Card with tiers + local ranking
- Made share the primary CTA on score screen
- Rewrote Solution opening with emotion first, explanation second
- Folded objections into body copy, killed standalone section
- Rewrote Hero bullets for emotional states
- Added referred-friend landing page copy

### Changes Applied in draft-copy-3.md

- Restructured hero to lead with bill breakdown insight ("for every krone") before any ask
- Sentence case throughout all headings and CTAs
- English only (Danish terms kept as cultural references)
- Problem section builds on hero stat rather than introducing it fresh
- Tightened EU directive claims ("require member states to support" vs. "fund them")

## Review Round 2 — draft-copy-3.md

Three-agent review: Provider-Switch Perception Audit, Regression Check, Danish Reader Perception.

### Key Finding: Copy reads like a provider-switch pitch

Founder's instinct confirmed by all three agents. The problem is structural, not cosmetic:

1. **Savings language dominates ownership language.** Every time the copy explains why Energy Communities matter, it reaches for "save/savings." The emotional payoff is always financial. This means the reader's mental model is: "this is a way to pay less" — which is definitionally a provider-switch pitch, regardless of mechanism.

2. **"You become the provider" backfires in Danish context.** Most Danish electricity retailers are already cooperatives or municipal entities. Saying "become the provider" positions Energy Communities as just another elselskab. The line collapses the structural argument into a retail argument.

3. **The Differentiation section reveals the problem.** If you need an entire section arguing "this isn't switch and save," the earlier sections already failed. The section's existence is a symptom, not a cure.

4. **CTAs are comparison-tool generic.** "Get your personal energy report" is what Elpris offers. "See where your money goes" is every comparison site's H2.

5. **The emotional arc is identical to switch-marketing.** You pay too much → here's how to pay less. Same structure, different vocabulary.

### Provider-Switch Perception — Section-by-Section

| Section         | Risk                                                                                    | Severity     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Hero            | H2 and "save" bullet trigger comparison-tool pattern                                    | Moderate     |
| Problem         | Emotional arc identical to switch agitation; cooperative pivot comes last               | Low-moderate |
| The Shift       | "You become the provider" reinforces switch frame; "savings" language                   | Moderate     |
| Solution        | "Cut out the layers" = middleman-disruption language                                    | Moderate     |
| Differentiation | Exists because earlier sections failed; argues against frame using frame's own language | High         |
| Closing CTA     | "Get your personal energy report" is pure comparison-tool language                      | High         |
| Score Card      | Score drop promise = "we'll make your number better" = solution-provider logic          | Moderate     |

### Danish Reader Trust Issues

- **No institutional identity.** Who is behind this? Anonymous marketing is suspicious marketing in Denmark.
- **No business model stated.** Danes assume commercial interest; silence increases suspicion.
- **"No sales pitch" disclaimers increase suspicion.** The moment you say it, you confirm you know it looks like one.
- **Urgency tactics don't work in Denmark.** "Early movers get access to the most favorable terms" = classic FOMO. Danes close the tab.
- **Fabricated testimonials are detectable.** The v3 placeholders read like copywriter fantasies, not real people.
- **Cooperative framing is invoked but not felt.** Andels tradition used as rhetorical device, not lived detail. Never acknowledges that cooperatives are actual work (general meetings, collective decisions).
- **"Permanently change how you look at your bill"** = grandiose. No tool does this.
- **"Your grandparents built cooperatives. Your turn."** = telling Danes what to feel about their own history. Uncomfortable.

### Regression Check — v3 Status

18 of 23 original findings fully fixed. 4 partially fixed. Zero regressions. Partial fixes:

- Leaderboard/challenge mechanics still absent
- Hero bullets improved but still feature-adjacent, not emotional states
- Varmecheck crisis context still missing
- Renter inclusion softer but no explicit caveat

### New Issues in v3

- The "16–22 øre per krone" figure needs source verification before publication
- Triple repetition of same stat (positioning, hero, problem) may feel redundant
- Score card "would drop to 2.1" is a specific numerical claim needing robust backing

### Root Cause

The copy uses the emotional mechanics, language patterns, and structural arc of provider-switch marketing while trying to sell something fundamentally different. The fix requires:

- **Ownership-first, not savings-first.** Replace "save" with "keep" and "own" throughout.
- **Kill the provider frame entirely.** Not "become the provider" — "own the infrastructure."
- **Trust through transparency.** State who you are, what it costs, what's hard, what's real.
- **Let the cooperative model be the differentiator,** not a rhetorical decoration on top of savings claims.

### Changes Applied in draft-copy-4.md

- Replaced savings-first framing with ownership-first framing throughout
- Killed "You become the provider" — replaced with infrastructure ownership language
- Removed standalone Differentiation section; folded best arguments into Solution
- Replaced "save/savings" payoffs with "keep/own" language
- Rewrote CTAs to signal community action ("See what your neighborhood qualifies for")
- Added "Who is behind this" section for institutional transparency
- Added concrete ownership example (school roof, shared battery, 23 households)
- Acknowledged real effort honestly (6–12 months, general meetings, costs not always covered)
- Added explicit renter regulation caveat
- Removed urgency tactics, FOMO language, "no sales pitch" disclaimers
- Testimonial placeholders explicitly require real, unpolished quotes
- Added production notes for data verification
- Rewrote closing to state cooperative history without generational guilt
- Score card reframed: "your street would own the infrastructure" vs. specific score-drop claim
