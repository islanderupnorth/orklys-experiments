# "How Screwed Are You?" — Landing Page Copy v2

*Changes from v1: Rewrote for Danish cultural fit, fixed energy market inaccuracies, restructured around the Screwed Score as centerpiece, added viral loop mechanics, adopted dry truth-telling tone, rooted in andelsbevægelsen.*

## Positioning Overview

Most of your energy bill isn't energy. It's layers — tariffs, taxes, system fees, transmission charges — stacked on top of each other in a structure nobody asked you to approve. Energy Communities don't fight the system. They sidestep it. The same cooperative model that built Danish agriculture and wind energy, applied to your street's electricity. The "Screwed Score" makes the invisible visible: a clear, shareable number showing where your money actually goes. The arc is: clarity → recognition → "wait, we already know how to fix this" → action.

## [Section: Problem + Agitation]

### Your Bill Has a Story. You're Not Going to Like It.

You paid your electricity bill last month. Probably didn't think about it much. It came, you paid, you moved on.

Here's what you paid for:

For every krone on your bill, roughly **[PLACEHOLDER: 0.XX kr]** went to actual electricity. The rest? Nettarif. Systemtarif. Transmissionstarif. Elafgift. Moms. Layer after layer of costs for a grid you don't own, managed by companies you didn't choose, structured in ways nobody ever explained to you.

This isn't a conspiracy. Nobody's twirling a moustache. It's just a system that was built for a different era — centralized power plants, long-distance transmission, one-way delivery. You receive. You pay. End of story.

Except it doesn't have to be the end of the story. Because the Danes who came before you already solved this problem once — they just solved it for dairy and wind turbines instead of your electricity bill.

## [Section: The Shift — Emotion First]

### What If Your Street Kept Every Krone?

Picture this. The money you spend on electricity every month stops flowing through six layers of infrastructure and fees. Instead, it stays right here. On your street. Powering your neighbors' houses. Under your collective control.

You don't switch providers. You become the provider.

You and your neighbors. Together. The same model your great-grandparents used when they built the andelsmejerier. The same model that made Denmark the world leader in wind energy. Applied to the one thing everyone on your street already pays for.

It's called an Energy Community. And it's not new — it's the oldest idea in Denmark, applied to a modern problem.

---

## [Section: Solution + How It Works]

### How It Actually Works

An Energy Community is a legally recognized cooperative structure — defined under EU law, supported by Danish regulation, backed by real funding.

- **Shared solar, shared storage, shared savings.** Your street or block installs generation and storage collectively. The electricity you produce stays local. The economics work because you cut out the layers between generation and consumption.
- **You don't need a south-facing roof.** This isn't individual solar panels. It's collective infrastructure. Renters, apartment dwellers, anyone on the street participates. The andels model was built to include everyone — this is no different.
- **The funding already exists.** The EU and Danish government have earmarked **[PLACEHOLDER: specific program + amount]** for citizen energy initiatives. Most people don't know this money is on the table. It's there specifically to help communities like yours get started.
- **You keep control.** No external shareholders. No corporate parent company. Your community sets the rules, shares the savings, and owns the infrastructure. Just like an andelsboligforening, but for electricity.

The legal framework is in place. The funding is available. Communities across Denmark and Europe are already doing this. The only thing missing is your street deciding to start.

---

## [Section: Differentiation / "Why This Is Different"]

### This Isn't "Switch and Save." This Is Ownership.

You've been told to switch providers a hundred times. Same grid. Same tariffs. Different logo on the bill.

An Energy Community is structurally different:

- **A provider switch saves you øre. Ownership saves you the entire margin.** When your community generates its own electricity, the nettarif and intermediary costs that make up most of your bill start to shrink — because the distance between generation and consumption drops to meters, not kilometers.
- **Denmark already proved this works.** The andelsmejerier. The vindmøllelaug. The fjernvarmeselskaber. Danish cooperative infrastructure is the envy of Europe. Energy Communities are the next chapter of the same story.
- **The EU is betting on this — with money.** Directive 2019/944 and RED II don't just permit Energy Communities. They fund them. Denmark's implementation is underway, and early movers have access to the most favorable terms.

## [Section: Social Proof]

### It's Already Happening

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 1]**
> "We started with 14 households. The process took about 8 months. Our electricity costs dropped by **[PLACEHOLDER: X%]** — but honestly, the best part is knowing the money stays in our community."
> — *[Name], [Location], Denmark*

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 2]**
> "I checked my score on a Tuesday evening out of curiosity. By Thursday I'd sent the link to everyone on my street. Turns out we were all quietly annoyed about the same thing."
> — *[Name], [Location]*

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 3]**
> "I rent. I assumed this wasn't for me. It is."
> — *[Name], [Location]*

### The Numbers
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X,XXX]** people have checked their Screwed Score
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X]** Energy Communities initiated through this tool
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X%]** average reduction in electricity costs for participating communities
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X]** billion DKK in available EU/national funding for citizen energy projects

## [Section: Practical Concerns — Woven In, Not Listed]

*Note: No standalone objection section. Key concerns are addressed naturally throughout the copy. The following are additional confidence-builders to weave into surrounding sections or display as subtle callouts:*

### For Renters
> Energy Communities are designed around the andels principle: everyone who participates, benefits. You don't need to own a roof. You need to live somewhere and pay a bill.

### On Cost
> The Screwed Score is free. Setting up an Energy Community has startup costs — but these are typically covered by EU and national grants. We'll show you exactly which funding programs your postcode qualifies for.

### On Time
> You don't have to organize your entire neighborhood alone. Most communities start with one person sending a link. The tool does the heavy lifting.

### On "Too Good to Be True"
> It's not magic. It's infrastructure plus cooperative law plus collective action. The math works because you're removing intermediary layers, not because someone is subsidizing you. Denmark has been doing this with other sectors for 150 years.

## [Section: Closing Argument + Final CTA]

### Your Grandparents Built Cooperatives. Your Turn.

The andels model built Danish agriculture. It built Danish wind energy. It built the housing cooperatives that half of Copenhagen lives in. Every time, the idea was the same: why pay someone else when you can own it together?

Your electricity bill is the last holdout. The legal framework is ready. The funding is waiting. Communities are already forming.

The only question is whether your street starts now — or waits until someone else's does.

### Score Result Screen

**YOUR SCREWED SCORE**

# 7.8 / 10

## "Systemets Bedste Kunde"
*(The System's Best Customer)*

You're more screwed than **[PLACEHOLDER: 84%]** of households in **[PLACEHOLDER: 8000 Aarhus C]**.

Of your **[PLACEHOLDER: 2,847 DKK]** monthly bill, roughly **[PLACEHOLDER: 612 DKK]** is actual electricity. The rest is tariffs, fees, and taxes for infrastructure you don't own.

**In an Energy Community, your score would drop to approximately [PLACEHOLDER: 2.1].**

**[Primary CTA — Large] Share Your Score**
*Think your neighbors know their number?*

**[Secondary CTA — Smaller] See How to Fix This →**

### Pre-Written Share Text
"My Screwed Score is 7.8/10 — I'm 'The System's Best Customer.' Check yours → [link]"

### Score Tier Labels
| Score | Label (DA) | Label (EN) |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 8-10 | Systemets Bedste Kunde | The System's Best Customer |
| 6-8 | Stille Betaler | The Quiet Payer |
| 4-6 | Mildt Irriteret | Mildly Annoyed |
| 2-4 | Nogenlunde | Getting By |
| 0-2 | Næsten Fri | Almost Free |

*Note: Labels use dry Danish humor. The highest-screwed tier is not aggressive — it's sardonic. "The System's Best Customer" is an ironic compliment that Danes will immediately understand and share.*

## [Section: Referred Friend Landing Page]

*When someone shares their score, the link goes HERE — not the main landing page. This is the viral loop engine.*

### Referred Friend Variant

**Your neighbor scored 7.8 out of 10.**
**They're "Systemets Bedste Kunde."**

How screwed are you?

[Postcode] [Monthly amount]
**[CTA] Check My Score**

**[PLACEHOLDER: X] people in [friend's postcode area] checked in the last 24 hours.**

*Note: This page is minimal — no long-form copy. One comparison hook, one input, one button. The main landing page exists for people who need convincing. The referred page is for people who are already curious because a friend shared.*

---

## [Section: Re-Share Prompt — After Friend Gets THEIR Score]

*After the referred friend sees their own score, prompt the second share to keep the loop going:*

> **Your score: 6.4 / 10 — "Stille Betaler"**
>
> Your neighbor scored 7.8. You scored 6.4.
> But you're still more screwed than **[PLACEHOLDER: 67%]** of households in your area.
>
> **[CTA] Share Your Score** — *See who else on your street is getting screwed.*
>
> **[CTA] Start a Conversation** — *See what an Energy Community could mean for [postcode area].*
