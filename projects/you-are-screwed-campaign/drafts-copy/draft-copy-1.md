# "How Screwed Are You?" — Landing Page Copy v1

## Positioning Overview

This campaign weaponizes the universal frustration of high energy bills into a viral moment. Instead of lecturing people about green energy or guilting them about carbon, we meet them where they already are: pissed off about what they pay. The "Screwed Score" gives that vague feeling a concrete, shareable number — and then pivots to the real message: you don't have to take this. Energy Communities let ordinary people own their electricity, and there's funding right now to make it happen. The arc is: outrage → "wait, there's actually a solution?" → empowerment → action.

## [Section: Problem + Agitation]

### You Already Know Something Is Off

Every month, you open that bill and feel the same thing. That little knot in your stomach. That voice in the back of your head going: *"This can't be right."*

It's not right.

Here's what your energy company won't tell you: the price you pay has almost nothing to do with the actual cost of generating your electricity. You're paying for bloated infrastructure you don't own. You're subsidizing shareholder dividends. You're funding executive bonuses at companies that posted record profits while your bill went up **[PLACEHOLDER: X%]** last year.

And the worst part? You've been told there's nothing you can do about it. Switch providers? Same system, different logo. Install solar panels? Sure — if you have **[PLACEHOLDER: XX,XXX DKK]** lying around and a south-facing roof.

You're not imagining it. You ARE getting screwed. And we can prove it.

## [Section: Solution + How It Works]

### There's a Way Out. And It Already Exists.

It's called an Energy Community. It's not a startup pitch or a government pilot. It's a legal framework — backed by EU directives and national funding — that lets regular people in a neighborhood collectively own and share energy infrastructure.

Think of it as: your street, your energy, your rules.

Here's how it works:

- **You upload your energy bill** — our tool analyzes it and shows your Screwed Score: a concrete number showing how much you're overpaying
- **You see what an Energy Community could save you** — based on real data from your area, not hypothetical projections
- **You connect with neighbors who are just as fed up** — because this works best when a whole street or block does it together
- **Together, you launch your Energy Community** — shared solar, shared storage, shared savings. Supported by EU funding that already exists
- **You own your electricity** — not a corporation. You. Your neighbors. Your community.

The funding is there. The legal framework is there. The only thing missing is you deciding you've had enough.

## [Section: Differentiation / "Why Us"]

### This Isn't About Switching Providers. It's About Taking Ownership.

You've heard "switch and save" a thousand times. This is fundamentally different.

- **You don't switch providers — you BECOME the provider.** An Energy Community means you and your neighbors collectively generate, store, and share energy. The middleman isn't cheaper. The middleman is gone.

- **This isn't a petition or a protest — it's infrastructure.** Energy Communities are a legally recognized structure under the EU Clean Energy Package. This is real, it's funded, and it's happening right now across Europe.

- **The money is already on the table.** The EU and Danish government have allocated **[PLACEHOLDER: X billion DKK/EUR]** in funding for citizen energy initiatives. That money exists to help communities like yours get started. Most people don't even know it's there.

- **It's not just for homeowners with solar roofs.** Renters, apartment dwellers, anyone who pays an energy bill can participate. Energy Communities are designed to be inclusive — not just for people who already have the resources.

- **Your neighbors want this. They just don't know it yet.** In a **[PLACEHOLDER: 2024/2025]** survey, **[PLACEHOLDER: X%]** of Danish households said they'd join a community energy project if one existed in their area. The demand is there. Someone just needs to start it.

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 2]**

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 3]**

## [Section: Objection Handling]

### "Yeah, But..."

**"Is this actually legal?"**
Yes. Energy Communities are defined and protected under the EU Clean Energy Package (Directive 2019/944) and transposed into Danish law. This isn't a hack or a workaround. It's a legal right that governments are actively funding.

**"I'm renting. This isn't for me."**
It absolutely is. Energy Communities are specifically designed to include renters. You don't need to own a roof. You need to live somewhere and pay an energy bill. That's it.

**"I don't have time to organize my neighborhood."**
You don't have to do it alone. We provide the tools, the templates, and the community to help you get started. Most Energy Communities start with one motivated person and grow from there. That person could be you — or you could join one someone else starts.

**"Sounds too good to be true."**
We get that. Here's the thing: energy companies have spent decades making you believe there's no alternative. There is. It's not magic. It's infrastructure, law, and collective action. The math works because you're cutting out the middleman — not because someone is subsidizing your bill out of kindness.

**"How much does this cost me?"**
The Screwed Score tool is completely free. Forming an Energy Community has setup costs, but these are typically covered or heavily subsidized by available EU and national grants. We'll show you exactly what funding you qualify for based on your location.

**"What if my neighbors aren't interested?"**
That's what the Screwed Score is for. Share yours. Let them check theirs. We've found that once people see the numbers, the conversation starts itself. Outrage is contagious — in a good way.

## [Section: Closing Argument + Final CTA]

### You Have Two Options

**Option 1:** Close this tab. Pay next month's bill. Feel that knot in your stomach again. Repeat for the next 10, 20, 30 years.

**Option 2:** Upload your bill. See your score. Share it. Start a conversation with your neighbors. And begin the process of actually owning the electricity you pay for every single month.

The funding is there. The legal framework is there. Communities across Denmark and Europe are already doing this. The only question is whether you're going to keep getting screwed — or do something about it.

### Final CTA Block

**Stop Getting Screwed. Start Owning Your Energy.**

Your Screwed Score takes 30 seconds. Your Energy Community could save you thousands. And the funding to make it happen? It's already waiting for you.
