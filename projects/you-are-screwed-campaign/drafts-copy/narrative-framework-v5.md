# "How Screwed Are You?" — Narrative Framework for v5

_This document is a storytelling blueprint. It does not contain finished copy. It contains the narrative architecture — the story, the characters, the emotional beats, the tone — that a copywriter uses to write the actual sections._

_Why this exists: v1–v4 were conversion-focused documents with a storytelling problem. They explained well but never told a story. They had arguments but no narrative arc. They had a villain (the system) and a solution (Energy Communities) but no journey between them. This framework builds the journey first, then maps the page to it._

## 1. THE STORY WE ARE TELLING

### The one-paragraph version

Denmark has a 150-year habit of looking at something expensive, essential, and controlled by someone else — and deciding to own it together instead. Dairy farmers did it. Wind energy pioneers did it. Housing cooperatives did it. Each time, the pattern was identical: a shared dependency became a shared asset. Each time, the people involved were not activists or visionaries — they were neighbors who did the math and had a conversation. Your electricity bill is the latest version of the same dependency. The infrastructure exists to change it. The only thing that hasn't happened yet is the conversation on your street.

### The three-act structure

**Act I — The invisible arrangement.**
You pay your electricity bill every month. You have done this for years. You have never once looked at it and thought, "this is well-designed." But you have also never looked at it and thought, "I could change this." The bill arrives. You pay. The money leaves. It has always been this way. Act I establishes that the reader is inside a system they did not choose, never examined, and assumed was fixed — not because anyone lied to them, but because no one ever told them there was anything to examine.

**Act II — The pattern recognition.**
Then the page does something unusual. It does not pitch a product. It tells a history. It says: this is not the first time Danes found themselves paying too much into a system they did not own. The dairy farmers in the 1880s were in the same position — selling milk to private dairies at whatever price the dairy set, watching the margin disappear into someone else's business. They did not protest. They did not switch dairies. They built their own. They called them andelsmejerier. And then they did it again with wind turbines (vindmollelaug). And again with housing (andelsboligforeninger). Act II is the realization that the reader's situation is not new, not unique, and not unsolvable — because their own culture already solved it, repeatedly, using the same mechanism each time.

**Act III — The street.**
The story narrows from national history to one street. Your street. What does it look like when this pattern happens here? Not in the 1880s, not at a national scale, but on the specific road where you live? Solar panels on the school roof at the end of the block. A shared battery in a community building. Twenty-three households generating, storing, and sharing electricity among themselves. The money that used to flow through six intermediary layers now circulates between neighbors. The closing image is not a lower bill. It is infrastructure you can see from your front door, owned by people you know by name.

### Why this structure works

The conversion versions (v1–v4) followed a marketing arc: Problem, Agitation, Solution, CTA. That arc creates urgency but not meaning. It tells you something is wrong and offers to fix it. The storytelling arc does something different: it places you inside a pattern that is bigger than your bill and older than your lifetime, and then asks whether you want to continue the pattern or break from it. The conversion arc says "act now." The storytelling arc says "you already know how to do this."

## 2. THE VILLAIN

### What the villain is NOT

The villain is not your energy company. Most Danish electricity retailers are cooperatives or municipal entities. Framing them as villains is factually wrong and culturally tone-deaf. Danish audiences will close the tab.

The villain is not greed or corruption. There is no conspiracy. Nobody is twirling a moustache. The system works exactly as it was designed to work. The problem is what it was designed for.

The villain is not even "the system" as an abstraction. V2–v4 used "a system not designed for you" as the villain, which is accurate but emotionally inert. Systems are hard to feel anything about.

### What the villain IS

The villain is **distance**. Physical and structural distance between you and your electricity.

Your electricity is generated far away. It travels through transmission lines, substations, distribution grids. Each layer of distance adds a layer of cost: transmissionstarif for the long-distance journey, nettarif for the local grid, systemtarif for the balancing act, elafgift as a tax on the whole chain, moms on top of everything. By the time the electricity reaches your meter, roughly 78–84% of what you paid was for the journey, not the destination.

This is the villain: the gap between where your electricity comes from and where you are. Not malice. Geometry. Infrastructure built for a world where electricity could only flow in one direction, from a few large plants to millions of homes, across hundreds of kilometers. That world made sense in 1960. It is still the world your bill is structured for.

### How to make distance feel like an antagonist

The key narrative device is **the krone's journey**. Follow a single krone from the moment it leaves your bank account. Where does it go? Through how many hands? How far does it travel? How much of it arrives at the thing you actually wanted — electricity — and how much of it pays for the trip?

This is not angry. It is not conspiratorial. It is a travelogue. "Let's follow the money." The tone is curious, almost amused. The emotion comes not from outrage but from the absurdity of the distance — the sheer number of stops along the way, each one perfectly rational in isolation, collectively responsible for the fact that you pay a krone and get 16–22 ore worth of electricity.

The villain becomes tangible not through accusation but through specificity. Name the tariffs. Explain what each one pays for. Let the reader feel the accumulation. The emotional effect is not "they are screwing me" but "this is incredibly convoluted, and I never realized how much of my money goes to maintaining the convolution."

### The villain's redeeming quality (critical for Danish tone)

The system is not evil. It actually worked. It electrified Denmark. It kept the lights on. It funded the grid that now makes renewable energy possible. The narrative must acknowledge this honestly. The point is not that the system was bad — the point is that it was built for a problem that has been largely solved (centralized generation, long-distance delivery) and that a new possibility now exists (local generation, local consumption, cooperative ownership). The system is not the villain because it failed. It is the villain because it succeeded at something that is no longer the only option.

This framing is crucial for Danish audiences. Danes respect functional infrastructure. They distrust people who tear things down without acknowledging what was built. The narrative needs to say: this was well-built for its time. Its time is passing.

## 3. THE PROTAGONIST

### Why the protagonist is not the individual

V1–v3 made a classic marketing mistake: they addressed "you" as an individual consumer making an individual decision. But Energy Communities are fundamentally collective. If "you" check your score and "you" decide to act, you still cannot do anything alone. The unit of action is not the person. It is the neighborhood.

Making the individual the protagonist creates a narrative problem: the climax requires other people, which means the story's resolution depends on something outside the protagonist's control. That is unsatisfying in a story and paralyzing in a CTA.

### The street as character

The protagonist is **your street**. Not as a metaphor — as a literal, physical place. The road you live on. The buildings you walk past. The people whose names you half-know.

The street becomes a character through specificity and accumulation:

**Specificity:** The copy should evoke the physical reality of a Danish residential street. Not a generic neighborhood but the particular feeling of a Danish villavej or a boligforening — the shared hedge, the fællesareal, the yellow brick, the bike parked outside. The reader should see their own street, not an abstract concept.

**Accumulation:** The street's "character trait" is that everyone on it has the same problem and nobody knows it. Every household pays the same tariffs. Every household's money flows through the same six layers. Every household gets 16–22 ore of electricity per krone. The street is a character defined by a shared condition that has never been shared — because nobody talks about their electricity bill. The dramatic tension is in the gap between the shared reality and the shared silence.

### The street's character arc

**Beginning:** A collection of individuals, each paying their bill alone, each assuming their situation is private and unchangeable. They live next to each other but are not, in any meaningful sense, together on this.

**Middle:** The Screwed Score makes the private visible. One person checks their score and shares it. A neighbor checks theirs. The realization is not "I am screwed" — it is "we are all screwed identically." The score does not individuate; it reveals a pattern. Everyone on the street has roughly the same number. The problem is not personal. It is structural and geographic.

**End:** The street becomes a cooperative. Not through activism or ideology but through the same pragmatic logic that built every andel in Danish history: why are we all paying separately for something we could own together? The street goes from a collection of bill-payers to a collective of infrastructure-owners. The character arc is: isolation, recognition, cooperation.

### How to make "your street" feel alive in the copy

- Use the second person plural where possible. Not always "you" but "your street," "your neighbors," "the 23 households between the school and the roundabout."
- Describe the physical infrastructure as it would appear on the street: "solar panels on the school roof at the end of your road," not "distributed energy generation assets."
- The recurring image is money flowing out of the street (to distant infrastructure) versus money circulating within the street (in a cooperative). The street is a container. Right now, it leaks. An Energy Community plugs the leak.
- The most powerful moment in the copy should not be about an individual realizing they are overpaying. It should be about realizing that everyone on the street already knows, or half-knows, or suspects — and nobody has said it aloud yet. The Screwed Score is the thing that turns a private suspicion into a shared fact.

## 4. EMOTIONAL BEATS BY SCROLL SECTION

### Section 1: Hero
**What they feel:** Mild curiosity with an edge of recognition.
**The beat:** "Huh. I've never actually thought about what's in my bill."
**Emotional function:** This is not a hook. This is a quiet provocation. "How screwed are you?" should not feel aggressive — it should feel like a question a dry, slightly sardonic friend would ask at a dinner party. The subline ("For every krone on your energy bill, roughly 16–22 ore is actual electricity") is the real hook, and it works not through provocation but through specificity. The number is small enough to be surprising and concrete enough to be believable.
**Key risk:** If this section feels confrontational or salesy, Danish readers will leave immediately. It must feel like a factual observation delivered with a slight eyebrow raise, not a fist on the table.
**Transition to next section:** Curiosity. "Wait, only 16–22 ore? Where does the rest go?"

### Section 2: The krone's journey (Problem + Agitation)
**What they feel:** Growing disbelief, then wry recognition.
**The beat:** "I knew it was bad but I didn't know it was THIS specific."
**Emotional function:** This is the section where "distance" (the villain) becomes tangible. Follow the krone. Name each stop. Nettarif. Systemtarif. Transmissionstarif. Elafgift. Moms. The feeling should accumulate like items on a receipt — each one individually unremarkable, collectively absurd. The tone is not angry. It is the tone of someone reading the fine print aloud for the first time and saying, "Really? And then this too? And on top of that?"
**The aha moment:** "Nobody designed this to screw you. It just wasn't designed for you at all." This is the line that reframes the emotion from outrage (which Danes distrust) to clarity (which Danes respect). The reader should feel not that they have been cheated, but that they have been living inside an arrangement they never examined.
**Tension:** The tension is in the specificity. The more precisely you name the fees, the more the reader feels the weight of the system. But the tension must release — it cannot build to anger because anger with nowhere to go is just frustration, and frustrated people close tabs.
**Release:** The pivot to history. "But this is Denmark. And the Danes who came before you already solved exactly this kind of problem." The release is not in a product. It is in a pattern. The tension of the present resolves into the familiarity of the past.
**Transition to next section:** "Wait. They solved it? How?"

### Section 3: The history (The Shift)
**What they feel:** Recognition and maybe a quiet kind of pride.
**The beat:** "Oh. Right. We do this. We've always done this."
**Emotional function:** This is the narrative heart of the page. This is where the story becomes bigger than a bill and bigger than a product. The section tells three stories in miniature:

1. **Dairy, 1880s.** Farmers selling milk to private dairies at whatever price the dairy offered. Margins disappearing into someone else's business. The solution: build our own dairy. The andelsmejeri. A group of farmers deciding that what they all depended on, they should all own. This was not ideology. It was arithmetic.

2. **Wind energy, 1970s–80s.** Communities pooling money to build shared wind turbines. The vindmollelaug. Not a government program — a neighborhood decision. Denmark became the world leader in wind energy not because of policy but because of cooperatives.

3. **Housing.** The andelsboligforeninger. Half of Copenhagen lives in them. Not because they are romantic or political but because they are practical: why would you pay rent to a landlord when you could own the building together?

Each of these stories follows the same three beats: shared dependency, shared realization, shared ownership. The section does not need to argue that Energy Communities are a good idea. It needs to show that the reader's culture already validated the model, three times, at national scale.

**The quiet pride:** Danish audiences will not respond to "Your grandparents built cooperatives. Your turn." (V2 tried this and the feedback was: "telling Danes what to feel about their own history is uncomfortable.") But they will respond to the pattern itself — the recognition that this is genuinely how Denmark works, told without sentimentality. The pride should arise organically from seeing the pattern, not be assigned by the copy.

**Key risk:** This section can easily become a history lecture. It needs to be told as stories, not as facts. Characters, not data. The farmer who was tired of the dairy's prices. The neighbors who pooled money for a windmill. Stories with people in them, not policy summaries.
**Transition to next section:** "So what does this look like for electricity? What does it look like for your street?"

### Section 4: Your street (The Solution)
**What they feel:** Imagination. Something like hope, but more concrete — more like picturing.
**The beat:** "I can actually see this. On my street."
**Emotional function:** This is the section that collapses the distance between history and now, between national story and personal reality. After three historical examples of the same pattern, the reader should feel the fourth as inevitable — not as a sales pitch but as a natural continuation.

The section must be intensely physical. Not "distributed energy infrastructure" but "solar panels on the school roof at the end of your road." Not "shared battery storage" but "a shared battery in the community building where you vote." Not "reduced tariffs" but "your electricity bill showing generation from 23 households, including yours."

**The ownership feeling:** V4 correctly identified that the emotional payoff is not savings but ownership. The feeling is not "I would pay less" but "I would see the thing. It would be there on my street. It would be ours." This is the same feeling that makes andelsboliger work psychologically — not the financial advantage but the sense that the place you live is yours in a way that renting never is.

**Tension (subtle):** The section must honestly acknowledge that this takes effort. General meetings. Collective decisions. 6–12 months. Real money. This honesty is not a dampener — in a Danish context, it is a trust-builder. Danes know that cooperative ownership means cooperative work. Acknowledging it signals that you understand what you are proposing.

**Transition to next section:** "Want to see the numbers for your street?"

### Section 5: The Screwed Score (The inciting incident, repositioned)
**What they feel:** Readiness, then the sharp clarity of a specific number.
**The beat:** "OK. Show me."
**Emotional function:** See Section 6 below for the full analysis of the score's narrative role. In the emotional arc, this is the moment where the story becomes personal. The reader has moved through curiosity (hero), understanding (krone's journey), recognition (history), and imagination (your street). They are now ready to see their own number — not as a cold open, but as the payoff of a journey.

The score lands harder here than it would at the top because the reader now understands what it means. A "7.8" at the top of the page is just a number. A "7.8" after the reader has followed the krone's journey, recognized the cooperative pattern, and imagined their street is a verdict: you are 7.8 screwed, and now you know exactly what that means and exactly what the alternative looks like.

### Section 6: The street's score (Social proof / neighborhood dimension)
**What they feel:** The shift from "my problem" to "our situation."
**The beat:** "Wait — everyone on my street has basically the same number?"
**Emotional function:** This is the most important emotional beat on the page. It is the moment where the protagonist shifts from the individual to the street. The score is personal. But when the reader sees that everyone in their postcode has roughly the same score — same tariffs, same grid company, same structural position — the problem stops being private and becomes geographic. This is the moment that makes cooperative action logical rather than idealistic.

**What happens here narratively:** The page reveals that the reader's score is not an individual failing or an individual bad deal. It is a structural feature of living at that address. Everyone on your street has essentially the same Screwed Score because everyone on your street is served by the same grid company and pays the same tariffs. The problem is collective. The solution must be collective.

This is where the comparison to dairy cooperatives lands with full weight: those farmers also did not have individual problems. They all sold milk to the same dairy. They all got the same price. The cooperative made sense precisely because the problem was shared.

### Section 7: Who is behind this (Trust)
**What they feel:** Relief. "OK, these are actual people."
**The beat:** "I was wondering when they'd say who they are."
**Emotional function:** Danish readers have been mentally asking this question since the hero section. Answering it late but honestly is better than not answering it at all or answering it early in a way that feels like branding. This section must be transparent to the point of discomfort: who you are, what your business model is, what you charge, what is hard, what you do not know yet. In Denmark, the gap between what a company says and what a company is can be measured in trust. Close the gap to zero.

### Section 8: Closing (The quiet call)
**What they feel:** Not urgency. Something more like readiness. The feeling of "I should probably talk to my neighbor about this."
**The beat:** "The only thing that hasn't happened yet is the conversation."
**Emotional function:** The closing must resist every conversion-copy instinct. No urgency. No FOMO. No "act now." The call to action is not to buy, sign up, or convert. It is to have a conversation. The most powerful CTA in this narrative framework is not "Check my score" — it is "Talk to your neighbor." The score is the tool. The conversation is the action.

The closing image: the andels model is 150 years old. Your electricity bill is the newest thing you can apply it to. Not a revolution. A continuation.

## 5. DANISH CULTURAL TONE

### What to avoid

- **Exclamation marks.** Every single one reads as American.
- **Superlatives.** "The best," "revolutionary," "game-changing" — Danes assume you are lying.
- **False urgency.** "Act now," "limited time," "early movers" — Danes close the tab.
- **Telling people how to feel.** "You should be outraged." Danes will decide for themselves whether they are outraged, thank you.
- **Grandiose framing.** "Change the world," "join the revolution," "be part of something bigger." Danes join things because they are practical, not because they are epic.
- **Disclaimers about not being a sales pitch.** The moment you say "this is not a sales pitch," you have confirmed it is.
- **Generational guilt.** "Your grandparents built cooperatives. Your turn." Do not tell Danes what to feel about their own history.
- **Emotional manipulation through scarcity or loss aversion.** Danes can smell this from three sentences away.

### What to aim for

The tone is a **smart friend at a dinner party who happens to know about energy policy.** Not a TED speaker. Not a politician. Not a brand voice. A person who has looked into something interesting, finds it genuinely surprising, and is telling you about it because they think you would find it interesting too.

Specific qualities:

- **Understated.** The most powerful facts should be delivered in the least dramatic voice. "For every krone on your bill, roughly 16–22 ore is actual electricity" is stronger as a plain statement than as a dramatic reveal.

- **Dry.** The humor should be so subtle that it barely registers as humor. "Systemets Bedste Kunde" works because it is exactly the kind of thing a Dane would say at a kitchen table — sardonic, self-deprecating, aware of the absurdity. The score tiers should all have this quality.

- **Curious, not angry.** The tone in the Problem section should feel like genuine curiosity about where the money goes — "huh, let's actually look at this" — not like outrage at a villain. Danes respond to clarity, not indignation.

- **Honest about difficulty.** A Danish-appropriate tone does not hide the effort required. "Forming a cooperative takes work. General meetings, collective decisions, paperwork. This is not a one-click solution." This kind of honesty reads as respect for the reader's intelligence.

- **Cooperative, not individualist.** The vocabulary should subtly favor collective action: "your street," "together," "your neighbors," "shared." Avoid the lone-hero language of "take control of YOUR bill" or "be the change."

- **Rooted in specifics.** Danish communication favors concrete detail over abstract principle. Not "a better energy future" but "solar panels on the school roof at the end of your road." Not "collective ownership" but "a cooperative where your household is one of 23 members."

### The acid test for tone

Read every sentence aloud. If it sounds like it could appear in a Facebook ad from a mattress company, cut it. If it sounds like something you would actually say to a friend while cooking dinner, keep it.

---

## 6. THE ROLE OF THE SCREWED SCORE

### In the conversion version (v1–v4)

The score is the hook. It opens the page. It is the first thing the reader engages with. The narrative logic is: get your number, feel something, learn about the solution, convert. The score drives traffic. The rest of the page drives conversion.

### In the storytelling version

The score is **the inciting incident of the street's story** — but it is not the opening.

Here is the distinction: in a conversion page, the score is a tool that makes you feel something so you will do something. In a storytelling page, the score is the moment where the story you have been hearing becomes your story. It is the point where abstract understanding ("the system takes 78–84% of your krone") becomes personal fact ("the system takes 78–84% of YOUR krone, and here is the number").

### Narrative placement: after the history, before the street

The optimal placement in the storytelling arc:

1. **Hero** — establishes the question ("how screwed are you?") and the core stat (16–22 ore per krone)
2. **The krone's journey** — makes the system visible and tangible
3. **The history** — shows that Danes have solved this pattern before
4. **THE SCORE** — "Now see your own number"
5. **The street's score** — "Everyone on your street has the same number"
6. **The solution** — "Here is what it looks like when your street owns the infrastructure"
7. **The close** — "The conversation is the only thing missing"

In this placement, the score is not the hook that gets people in the door. The story is the hook. The score is the moment the story gets personal — the turning point where the reader goes from observer to participant.

### Why this placement is better for storytelling

If you open with the score, the reader has a number but no framework for understanding it. "7.8" means nothing without context. The conversion versions try to provide context AFTER the score, which creates a persuasion problem: you are explaining to someone who already has a number why they should care about it.

If you tell the story first, the reader arrives at the score already understanding what it means. They know what the tariffs are. They know why the system looks like this. They know that Danes have solved similar problems before. The number is not a cold open — it is a confirmation. And a confirmation is emotionally stronger than a reveal, because the reader has already built the understanding. The number just makes it inescapably personal.

### The score's secondary role: the viral bridge

The score still needs to be shareable. The storytelling version does not sacrifice the viral mechanic — it recontextualizes it. When someone shares their score in the storytelling version, the pre-written share text should carry a trace of the narrative: not just "my Screwed Score is 7.8" but something that hints at the krone's journey or the cooperative history.

The referred-friend page remains minimal (as in v4): one number, one input, one button. But the main page that the referred friend can explore afterward is now the full story — and the story is what converts, not the score alone.

### The score's third role: making the street visible

The most important thing the score does in the storytelling version is not individuate — it is aggregating. When the page reveals that everyone in your postcode has roughly the same score, the score becomes evidence that the problem is structural and geographic, not personal. This is what makes cooperative action feel logical rather than idealistic. "We all have the same number because we are all on the same grid" is the single most important insight the score can deliver.

## 7. SECTION-BY-SECTION NARRATIVE MAP

_For the copywriter. Each section's story function, emotional target, and transitions._

| # | Section | Story function | Emotional target | Reader state entering | Reader state leaving | Transition device |
|---|---------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Hero | Establish the question | Mild curiosity, slight unease | Scrolling, half-attentive | "That's a weirdly specific number. Where does the rest go?" | The stat (16–22 ore) creates an information gap |
| 2 | The krone's journey | Make the villain (distance/system) tangible | Accumulating disbelief, then wry recognition | Curious about the breakdown | "This is absurdly convoluted. But also nobody designed it badly on purpose." | The pivot: "But this is Denmark..." |
| 3 | The history | Place the reader inside a pattern | Quiet recognition, maybe pride | Wondering if there is an alternative | "Oh. We do this. We have always done this." | "So what does this look like for electricity?" |
| 4 | Your street | Make the solution physical and imaginable | Concrete hope, picturing | Recognizing the pattern, ready for the present-day version | "I can see this on my street." | "Want to see your actual numbers?" |
| 5 | The Screwed Score | Make the story personal | Sharp clarity, the weight of a specific number | Ready and primed with understanding | "That's my number. And it means exactly what I thought." | "But here's the thing about your number..." |
| 6 | The street's score | Shift from individual to collective | The shift from "my problem" to "our situation" | Personal, slightly isolated | "Everyone here has the same number. This is a street problem." | "People who saw this pattern have already started." |
| 7 | It's already happening | Ground the story in reality | Credibility, reality check | Conceptually convinced, looking for proof | "OK, this is real. People are doing this." | "So who is asking me to look at this?" |
| 8 | Who is behind this | Build trust through transparency | Relief, respect | Wondering about the source | "These are actual people. They've told me what they charge." | Natural transition to close |
| 9 | Closing | Resolve the story | Readiness. Not urgency — the feeling of "I should talk to someone about this." | Informed, trusting, imagining | "The conversation is the only thing that hasn't happened yet." | CTA: the conversation starts with the score |

## 8. NARRATIVE DEVICES AND RECURRING MOTIFS

### The krone's journey
Follow a single krone from the reader's bank account through every intermediary layer. This device makes the abstract (tariffs) physical (a journey), and the villain (distance/system) tangible (stops along the way). Can be visualized on the page as a literal flow diagram.

### The three cooperatives
Dairy. Wind. Housing. These three examples are not decoration — they are the structural spine of the argument. Each one should be told as a micro-story (3–4 sentences) with a specific character or situation, not as a bullet point. The repetition of the pattern is the point: the third time, the reader should be completing the pattern before you state it.

### The street as container
The recurring image of money flowing out of the street (current system) versus circulating within the street (cooperative). The street is a membrane. Currently, it is permeable — money passes through. An Energy Community makes it retentive — money stays.

### The conversation
The ultimate action is not signing up, uploading, or converting. It is talking to a neighbor. This should recur as a motif: "someone on your street has to start the conversation," "the score is a way to have the conversation," "the hardest part is the first conversation." The CTA is a conversation, not a transaction.

### The quiet fourth cooperative
The three historical cooperatives (dairy, wind, housing) create an expectation of a fourth. The page never explicitly says "energy is the fourth." It lets the reader complete the pattern. The most persuasive argument is the one the reader constructs themselves.

---

## 9. WHAT THIS FRAMEWORK DOES NOT COVER

- **Finished copy.** This is architecture, not prose. A copywriter uses this to write sections.
- **Visual design.** The narrative implies certain visual treatments (the krone's journey as a flow diagram, the street as a physical image) but does not specify them.
- **The referred-friend page.** The viral loop mechanics from v4 remain valid. The referred page should be minimal. This framework is for the main storytelling page.
- **Danish-language adaptation.** This framework is in English. The final copy may be in Danish or bilingual. The tone guidance applies to both.
- **Data verification.** The 16–22 ore figure, the tariff breakdowns, and all numerical claims still require verification per the deep research prompt.

---

## 10. HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK

1. **Read the emotional beats map (Section 4) before writing anything.** The emotional journey is the backbone. If a section does not hit its emotional target, the story breaks.

2. **Write Section 3 (the history) first.** It is the hardest section and the narrative center of gravity. If the three cooperative stories do not work as stories — with characters, tension, and resolution — the rest of the page will feel like marketing with historical decoration.

3. **Test every sentence against the Danish tone guide (Section 5).** Read it aloud. If it sounds like an ad, cut it. If it sounds like a dinner conversation, keep it.

4. **Let the Screwed Score arrive late.** Resist the instinct to lead with it. The story earns the score. The score does not earn the story.

5. **End with the conversation, not the conversion.** The CTA is "talk to your neighbor." Everything else — the score, the upload, the email capture — is infrastructure for making that conversation happen.

_Narrative framework v5 — For use by copywriter. Not finished copy. The story is: your street is the fourth cooperative._
