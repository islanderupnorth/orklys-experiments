# "How Screwed Are You?" — Landing Page Copy v3

_Changes from v2: Restructured hero to lead with the bill breakdown insight before asking for any input. Moved the "for every krone" stat into subheadline position as the emotional hook. Sentence case throughout. Repositioned the input paths below the value statement so users understand WHY before they're asked to do anything._

---

## Positioning overview

Most of your energy bill isn't energy. For every krone you pay, roughly 16-22 øre goes to actual electricity. The rest is nettarif, systemtarif, transmissionstarif, elafgift, moms — layers of fees for infrastructure you don't own, managed by entities you didn't choose. Nobody designed this to screw you. It just wasn't designed for you at all.

Energy Communities sidestep the whole structure. Same cooperative model that built Danish agriculture and wind energy — applied to your street's electricity. The "Screwed Score" makes it concrete: one number showing how much of your money actually buys electricity, and how much just passes through your hands on the way to someone else's balance sheet.

The arc: see your number → realize everyone on your street has the same problem → discover that Danes solved this exact kind of problem 150 years ago → act on it.

## [Section: Hero]

### H1

**How screwed are you?**

### The hook

For every krone,- on your energy bill, roughly 16-22 øre is actual electricity.
The rest is tariffs, fees, and taxes for a grid you don't own.

### H2

See exactly where your money goes — and how much of it never needed to leave your street.

### What you'll get

- Your Screwed Score: a single number (0-10) showing how much of your bill is real electricity vs. everything else
- A line-by-line breakdown of where your money actually goes each month
- How your score compares to other households in your postcode
- What your street could save under the cooperative energy model Denmark already invented

## [Section: Problem + Agitation]

### Your bill has a story. You're not going to like it.

You already saw the number. For every krone on your bill, roughly 16-22 ore goes to actual electricity. The rest is a stack of tariffs and fees you never agreed to.

Let's name them. Nettarif — the cost of maintaining a grid you don't own. Systemtarif — for balancing a system you have no say in. Transmissionstarif — for moving electricity hundreds of kilometers when it could have been generated next door. Elafgift — a tax that once funded the green transition but now mostly just exists. And moms on top of all of it, because of course there is.

Nobody designed this to screw you personally. It's a system built for centralized power plants and one-way delivery. Electricity gets generated far away, travels through expensive infrastructure, passes through multiple regulated entities, and arrives at your meter with each layer's costs baked in. You receive. You pay. The money leaves your street and never comes back.

But this is Denmark. And the Danes who came before you already solved exactly this kind of problem — they just solved it for dairy, housing, and wind turbines instead of your electricity bill.

---

## [Section: The shift]

### What if your street kept every krone?

The money you spend on electricity every month flows through six layers of infrastructure and fees before anyone turns a light on. It doesn't have to.

Imagine it stays on your street instead. Powers your neighbors' houses. Comes back to you as savings rather than disappearing into a system designed for someone else's benefit.

You don't switch providers. You become the provider.

You and your neighbors. Together. The same model your great-grandparents used when they built the andelsmejerier. The same model that made Denmark the world leader in wind energy. Applied to the one thing everyone on your street already pays for.

It's called an Energy Community. It's not new. It's the oldest idea in Denmark, applied to a modern problem.

---

## [Section: Solution + How it works]

### How it actually works

An Energy Community is a legally recognized cooperative structure — defined under EU law, supported by Danish regulation, backed by real funding.

- **Shared solar, shared storage, shared savings.** Your street or block installs generation and storage collectively. The electricity you produce stays local. The economics work because you cut out the layers between generation and consumption — the same layers that make up most of your bill.

- **You don't need a south-facing roof.** This isn't individual solar panels. It's collective infrastructure. Renters, apartment dwellers, anyone on the street participates. The andels model was built to include everyone. This is no different.

- **The funding already exists.** The EU and Danish government have earmarked **[PLACEHOLDER: specific program + amount]** for citizen energy initiatives. Most people don't know this money is available. It exists specifically to help communities like yours get started.

- **You keep control.** No external shareholders. No corporate parent company. Your community sets the rules, shares the savings, and owns the infrastructure. Like an andelsboligforening, but for electricity.

The legal framework is in place. The funding is available. Communities across Denmark and Europe are already doing this. The only thing missing is your street deciding to start.

---

## [Section: Differentiation]

### This isn't "switch and save." This is ownership.

You've been told to switch providers a hundred times. Same grid. Same tariffs. Different logo on the bill. You save a few ore per kilowatt-hour and the structure stays identical.

An Energy Community is structurally different:

- **A provider switch saves you ore. Ownership saves you the entire margin.** When your community generates its own electricity, the nettarif and intermediary costs that dominate your bill start to shrink. The distance between generation and consumption drops from kilometers to meters. That's not a rounding error — that's the majority of what you pay.

- **Denmark already proved this works.** The andelsmejerier. The vindmollelaug. The fjernvarmeselskaber. Danish cooperative infrastructure is the envy of Europe. It wasn't a policy experiment. It was ordinary people deciding they'd rather own things together than pay someone else forever. Energy Communities are the next chapter of that same story.

- **The EU is betting on this — with money.** Directive 2019/944 and RED II don't just permit Energy Communities. They require member states to support them. Denmark's implementation is underway, and early movers get access to the most favorable terms.

## [Section: Practical concerns]

### For renters

> Energy Communities are built on the andels principle: everyone who participates, benefits. You don't need to own a roof. You need to live somewhere and pay a bill. The model was designed to include you, not work around you.

### On cost

> The Screwed Score is free. Setting up an Energy Community has startup costs — but these are typically covered by EU and national grants designed specifically for this purpose. We'll show you exactly which funding programs your postcode qualifies for.

### On time

> You don't have to organize your entire neighborhood alone. Most communities start with one person sending a link. The tool does the heavy lifting. Your job is to be the person who asks the question.

### On "too good to be true"

> It's not magic. It's infrastructure plus cooperative law plus collective action. The math works because you're removing intermediary layers, not because someone is subsidizing you out of goodwill. Denmark has been doing this with dairy, housing, and energy for 150 years. The only new part is applying it to your electricity bill.

## [Section: Social proof]

### It's already happening

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 1]**
> "We started with 14 households. Took about 8 months. Our electricity costs dropped by **[PLACEHOLDER: X%]**. But honestly, the part that surprised me was how simple it felt once we actually started. The hardest step was the first conversation."
> — _[Name], [Location], Denmark_

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 2]**
> "I checked my score out of curiosity on a Tuesday evening. By Thursday I'd sent the link to everyone on my street. We'd all been quietly annoyed about the same thing for years. Nobody had said it out loud."
> — _[Name], [Location]_

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 3]**
> "I rent. I assumed none of this applied to me. Turns out the andels model was literally designed for people like me."
> — _[Name], [Location]_

### The numbers

- **[PLACEHOLDER: X,XXX]** people have checked their Screwed Score
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X]** Energy Communities initiated through this tool
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X%]** average reduction in electricity costs for participating communities
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X]** billion DKK in available EU and national funding for citizen energy projects

## [Section: Closing argument + final CTA]

### Your grandparents built cooperatives. Your turn.

The andels model built Danish agriculture. It built Danish wind energy. It built the housing cooperatives that half of Copenhagen lives in.

Every time, the idea was the same: why pay someone else when we can own it together?

Your electricity bill is the last holdout. The legal framework exists. The funding is allocated. Communities are already forming across Denmark.

The only question is whether your street starts now or waits until the one around the corner does first.

### Final CTA block

## [Section: Screwed Score card — the viral centerpiece]

_This is what people see after checking their score. Designed for screenshots and sharing. Mobile-first (9:16 story ratio)._

### Score result screen

**YOUR SCREWED SCORE**

# 7.8 / 10

## "Systemets Bedste Kunde"

_(The system's best customer)_

You're more screwed than **[PLACEHOLDER: 84%]** of households in **[PLACEHOLDER: 8000 Aarhus C]**.

Of your **[PLACEHOLDER: 2,847 DKK]** monthly bill, roughly **[PLACEHOLDER: 612 DKK]** is actual electricity. The rest is tariffs, fees, and taxes for infrastructure you don't own.

**In an Energy Community, your score would drop to approximately [PLACEHOLDER: 2.1].**

---

**[Primary CTA — large] Share your score**
_Think your neighbors know their number?_

**[Secondary CTA — smaller] See how to fix this →**

### Pre-written share text

"My Screwed Score is 7.8/10 — I'm 'The System's Best Customer.' Check yours → [link]"

### Score tier labels

| Score | Label (DA)             | Label (EN)                 |
| ----- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 8-10  | Systemets Bedste Kunde | The system's best customer |
| 6-8   | Stille Betaler         | The quiet payer            |
| 4-6   | Mildt Irriteret        | Mildly annoyed             |
| 2-4   | Nogenlunde             | Getting by                 |
| 0-2   | Næsten Fri             | Almost free                |

_Labels use dry Danish humor. The highest tier is sardonic, not aggressive. "Systemets Bedste Kunde" is an ironic compliment Danes will immediately recognize and want to share._

---

## [Section: Referred friend landing page]

_When someone shares their score, the link goes here — not the main landing page. This is the viral loop engine._

### Referred friend variant

**Your neighbor scored 7.8 out of 10.**
**They're "Systemets Bedste Kunde."**

How screwed are you?

> [Postcode field] [Monthly amount field] > **[CTA] Check my score**

**[PLACEHOLDER: X] people in [friend's postcode area] have checked in the last 24 hours.**

_This page is minimal. One comparison hook, one input, one button. The main landing page exists for people who need convincing. This page is for people who are already curious because someone they know shared a number._

---

## [Section: Re-share prompt — after the referred friend gets their score]

_After the referred friend sees their own score, prompt the second share to keep the loop going._

> **Your score: 6.4 / 10 — "Stille Betaler"**
>
> Your neighbor scored 7.8. You scored 6.4.
> Still more screwed than **[PLACEHOLDER: 67%]** of households in your area.
>
> **[CTA] Share your score** — _Find out who else on your street is overpaying._
>
> **[CTA] Start a conversation** — _See what an Energy Community could mean for [postcode area]._

## Variants and testing ideas

### Alternative headlines (H1)

1. **"Where does your energy money actually go?"** — curiosity-led, less confrontational
2. **"Systemets Bedste Kunde"** — Danish-language lead, ironic, pattern-breaking in an English-copy context
3. **"Your bill has a story"** — narrative hook, softer entry point

### Alternative CTAs

1. **"Show me my score"** — playful, low friction
2. **"See my number"** — minimal, curiosity-driven
3. **"Find out"** — ultraminimal (works only if surrounding context does the heavy lifting)

### A/B test ideas

1. **Quick score vs. direct upload:** Does the zero-friction postcode path produce more completed scores than the bill upload path? Hypothesis: yes, by a wide margin. But upload users may convert to Energy Communities at a higher rate.
2. **Tier label language:** Danish-only labels vs. bilingual labels. Danish audience may share more with Danish-only labels (feels like an in-joke). Bilingual labels may perform better for broader reach.
3. **Hero approach:** "How screwed are you?" (confrontational) vs. "Where does your money go?" (curious). Test whether provocation or curiosity drives more score checks. Consider that Danish audiences may respond differently than other markets — dry humor lands, hard sells don't.
4. **Referred page minimal vs. context:** Test the ultra-minimal referred friend page against a version with one paragraph of context. Hypothesis: minimal wins for mobile, context wins for desktop.
