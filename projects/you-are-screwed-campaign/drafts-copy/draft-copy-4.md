# "How Screwed Are You?" — Landing page copy v4

_Changes from v3: Structural rewrite to fix "provider switch" perception. Replaced savings-first framing with ownership-first framing throughout. Killed "You become the provider" (positions Energy Communities as another elselskab in Danish context). Removed standalone Differentiation section — folded best arguments into Solution. Replaced all "save/savings" payoffs with "keep/own" language. Rewrote CTAs to signal community action, not individual optimization. Added institutional transparency (who is behind this, business model). Acknowledged what's actually hard. Removed urgency/FOMO tactics and "no sales pitch" disclaimers. Added concrete ownership example._

## Positioning overview

Most of your energy bill isn't energy. For every krone you pay, roughly 16–22 øre goes to actual electricity. The rest is nettarif, systemtarif, transmissionstarif, elafgift, moms — layers of fees for infrastructure you don't own, managed by entities you didn't choose. Nobody designed this to screw you. It just wasn't designed for you at all.

Energy Communities don't offer you a better deal on the same system. They let you and your neighbors own the infrastructure — the same cooperative model that built Danish agriculture, wind energy, and half of Copenhagen's housing. The "Screwed Score" makes the problem concrete: one number showing how much of your money actually buys electricity, and how much passes through your hands on the way to someone else's balance sheet.

The arc: see your number → realize everyone on your street has the same problem → discover that Danes solved this exact kind of problem 150 years ago → own the solution together.

## [Section: Hero]

### H1

**How screwed are you?** (NOT married to this title - please suggest alternatives)

### The hook

For every krone on your energy bill, roughly 16–22 øre is actual electricity.
The rest is tariffs, fees, and taxes for a grid you don't own.

### H2

Find out where your money goes — and what it looks like when your street owns the infrastructure instead.

### What you'll see

- Your Screwed Score: one number showing how much of your bill is actual electricity vs. everything else
- Where every krone goes — nettarif, systemtarif, elafgift, moms — named and quantified
- How your whole street is in the same position (and probably doesn't know it)
- What Denmark's cooperative tradition has to do with your electricity bill

## [Section: Problem + Agitation]

### Your bill has a story. You're not going to like it.

You already saw the number. For every krone on your bill, roughly 16–22 øre goes to actual electricity. The rest is a stack of tariffs and fees you never agreed to.

Let's name them. Nettarif — the cost of maintaining a grid you don't own. Systemtarif — for balancing a system you have no say in. Transmissionstarif — for moving electricity hundreds of kilometers when it could have been generated next door. Elafgift — a tax that once funded the green transition but now mostly just exists. And moms on top of all of it, because of course there is.

Nobody designed this to screw you personally. It's a system built for centralized power plants and one-way delivery. Electricity gets generated far away, travels through expensive infrastructure, passes through multiple regulated entities, and arrives at your meter with each layer's costs baked in. You receive. You pay. The money leaves your street and doesn't come back.

But this is Denmark. And the Danes who came before you already solved exactly this kind of problem — they just solved it for dairy, housing, and wind turbines instead of your electricity bill.

---

## [Section: The shift]

### What if your street owned it instead?

The money you spend on electricity every month flows through six layers of infrastructure and fees before anyone turns a light on. It doesn't have to.

Here is what it looks like when a street decides to own the infrastructure: solar panels on the roof of the school at the end of your road. A shared battery in a community building. Your electricity bill showing generation from 23 households, including yours. The money that used to flow through six entities now circulates between your neighbors. You don't have a provider. You have a cooperative.

This is not a new idea. Your great-grandparents did this with dairy — built the andelsmejerier because it was cheaper and better to own the creamery together than to sell milk to someone else's. Their children did it with wind energy — the vindmøllelaug that made Denmark the world leader. Their grandchildren did it with housing — the andelsboligforeninger that half of Copenhagen lives in.

Every time, the mechanism was the same: why pay someone else to own the thing you all depend on?

It's called an Energy Community. And the question it answers is not "which provider is cheapest?" It's "why do you need a provider at all?"

---

## [Section: How it works]

### How it actually works

An Energy Community is a legally recognized cooperative structure — defined under EU law (Directive 2019/944, RED II), supported by Danish regulation, and backed by dedicated funding programs.

- **Collective infrastructure, not individual panels.** Your street or block installs generation and storage together. The electricity you produce stays local. The economics work because the distance between generation and consumption drops from kilometers to meters — and most of the fees on your bill exist to cover that distance.

- **Everyone participates.** This isn't for homeowners with south-facing roofs. The andels model was built to include everyone who depends on the shared resource. Renters, apartment dwellers, anyone on the street. _Note: renter participation mechanisms are still being finalized in Danish regulation. The legal framework supports it; the practical details are catching up._

- **Dedicated EU and national funding exists.** The EU and Danish government have earmarked **[PLACEHOLDER: specific program + amount]** specifically for citizen energy initiatives. Most people don't know this money is available. It's not general-purpose subsidy — it exists to help communities like yours get started.

- **You own it. You govern it.** No external shareholders. No corporate parent. Your community sets the rules, makes the decisions, and owns the infrastructure. Like an andelsboligforening — including the general meetings and the collective responsibility.

Denmark already proved this works. The andelsmejerier. The vindmøllelaug. The fjernvarmeselskaber. It wasn't a policy experiment. It was ordinary people deciding they'd rather own things together than rent them from someone else. Energy Communities are the next chapter.

The legal framework is in place. The funding is available. Communities across Denmark and Europe are already operating. If it sounds straightforward, that's because the cooperative model is. The hard part is the same as it always was: someone on your street has to start the conversation.

## [Section: Practical concerns]

_No standalone section in the final design. These are woven into surrounding sections as subtle callouts or expandable details._

### For renters

> Energy Communities are built on the andels principle: everyone who participates, benefits. You don't need to own a roof. You need to live somewhere and pay a bill. The regulatory details for renter participation in Denmark are still being worked out — but the EU framework is explicitly designed to include you.

### On cost

> The Screwed Score is free. Setting up an Energy Community has real startup costs — equipment, legal structure, grid connection. EU and national grants are designed to cover the majority of this, but "typically covered" is not "always covered." We'll show you exactly which funding programs your postcode qualifies for and what the realistic out-of-pocket looks like.

### On effort

> Forming a cooperative takes work. General meetings, collective decisions, paperwork. This is not a one-click solution. Most communities take 6–12 months to set up. What we can do is handle the technical and regulatory complexity so you can focus on the part only you can do: talking to your neighbors.

### On "too good to be true"

> It's not magic. It's infrastructure plus cooperative law plus collective action. The math works because you're removing structural layers, not because anyone is subsidizing you. Denmark has been doing this with dairy, housing, and energy for 150 years. The only new part is applying it to your electricity bill. The reason more people haven't done it yet is that most people don't know it's an option — not because it doesn't work.

## [Section: Social proof]

### It's already happening

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 1 — use a real, unpolished quote]**
> "[Real quote from a community that has actually formed. Should sound like a real person, not a copywriter's ideal conversion story. Include something that was harder than expected.]"
> — _[Real name], [Real location], Denmark_

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 2]**
> "[Real quote from someone who checked their score and it led to a conversation. Keep the awkward phrasing. Don't edit for narrative arc.]"
> — _[Real name], [Real location]_

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Testimonial 3]**
> "[Real quote from a renter. If no renter testimonial exists yet, leave this blank rather than fabricating one.]"
> — _[Real name], [Real location]_

_Production note: These must be real quotes from real people. The draft testimonials in v1–v3 were too polished and would trigger skepticism in a Danish audience. Better to launch with one real quote than three fabricated ones._

### The numbers

- **[PLACEHOLDER: X,XXX]** people have checked their Screwed Score
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X]** Energy Communities initiated through this tool
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X%]** average reduction in electricity costs for participating communities
- **[PLACEHOLDER: X]** billion DKK in available EU and national funding for citizen energy projects

_Production note: Only publish numbers you can verify. If you have 200 score checks, say 200. Don't round up to "thousands" for social proof. Danish readers will fact-check you._

---

## [Section: Who is behind this]

_New section. The absence of institutional identity was flagged as the single biggest trust gap for Danish readers._

### About this tool

This tool is built by **Orklys**, a [PLACEHOLDER: one-sentence description — e.g., "Danish company helping neighborhoods form Energy Communities"].

**[PLACEHOLDER: What is your business model?]** _Be explicit. If you charge for community setup services, say so. If the tool is grant-funded, say so. If you take a percentage, say so. Danish readers will assume there's a commercial interest. Stating it openly builds more trust than hiding it._

**[PLACEHOLDER: Who are you?]** _Names, backgrounds, why you're doing this. A Danish reader trusts people, not brands._

---

## [Section: Closing argument + final CTA]

### The cooperative model is 150 years old. Your electricity bill is the newest thing you can apply it to.

The andels model built Danish agriculture. It built Danish wind energy. It built the housing cooperatives that half of Copenhagen lives in.

Every time, the mechanism was the same: a group of people decided they'd rather own something together than keep paying someone else for it.

Your electricity bill is the same kind of problem. The legal framework exists. The funding is allocated. Communities are already operating.

### Final CTA block

**See what your street is actually paying for.**

Your Screwed Score takes 30 seconds. It shows you where every krone goes — and what changes when the infrastructure is yours.

**[Primary CTA] Check my score**

**[Secondary CTA] See what your neighborhood qualifies for →**

## [Section: Screwed Score card — the viral centerpiece]

_This is what people see after checking their score. Designed for screenshots and sharing. Mobile-first (9:16 story ratio)._

### Score result screen

**YOUR SCREWED SCORE**

# 7.8 / 10

## "Systemets Bedste Kunde"

_(The system's best customer)_

You're more screwed than **[PLACEHOLDER: 84%]** of households in **[PLACEHOLDER: 8000 Aarhus C]**.

Of your **[PLACEHOLDER: 2,847 DKK]** monthly bill, roughly **[PLACEHOLDER: 612 DKK]** is actual electricity. The rest is tariffs, fees, and taxes for infrastructure you don't own.

**In an Energy Community, your street would own the infrastructure. Your score would look different.**

---

**[Primary CTA — large] Share your score**
_Think your neighbors know their number?_

**[Secondary CTA — smaller] What would this look like for your street? →**

### Pre-written share text

"My Screwed Score is 7.8/10 — I'm 'The System's Best Customer.' Check yours → [link]"

### Score tier labels

| Score | Label (DA)             | Label (EN)                 |
| ----- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 8-10  | Systemets Bedste Kunde | The system's best customer |
| 6-8   | Stille Betaler         | The quiet payer            |
| 4-6   | Mildt Irriteret        | Mildly annoyed             |
| 2-4   | Nogenlunde             | Getting by                 |
| 0-2   | Næsten Fri             | Almost free                |

_Labels use dry Danish humor. The highest tier is sardonic, not aggressive. "Systemets Bedste Kunde" is an ironic compliment Danes will immediately recognize and want to share._

---

## [Section: Referred friend landing page]

_When someone shares their score, the link goes here — not the main landing page. This is the viral loop engine._

### Referred friend variant

**Your neighbor scored 7.8 out of 10.**
**They're "Systemets Bedste Kunde."**

How screwed are you? (NOT married to this title - please suggest alternatives)

> [Postcode field] [Monthly amount field] > **[CTA] Check my score**

**[PLACEHOLDER: X] people in [friend's postcode area] have checked in the last 24 hours.**

_This page is minimal. One comparison hook, one input, one button. The main landing page exists for people who need convincing. This page is for people who are already curious because someone they know shared a number._

---

## [Section: Re-share prompt — after the referred friend gets their score]

_After the referred friend sees their own score, prompt the second share to keep the loop going._

> **Your score: 6.4 / 10 — "Stille Betaler"**
>
> Your neighbor scored 7.8. You scored 6.4.
> Still more screwed than **[PLACEHOLDER: 67%]** of households in your area.
>
> **[CTA] Share your score** — _See what number your neighbors get._
>
> **[CTA] What would this look like for your street?** — _See what an Energy Community could mean for [postcode area]._

---

## Variants and testing ideas

### Alternative headlines (H1)

1. **"Where does your energy money actually go?"** — curiosity-led, less confrontational
2. **"Systemets Bedste Kunde"** — Danish-language lead, ironic, pattern-breaking
3. **"Your bill has a story"** — narrative hook, softer entry point

### Alternative CTAs

1. **"Show me my score"** — playful, low friction
2. **"See my number"** — minimal, curiosity-driven
3. **"Find out"** — ultraminimal (works only if surrounding context does the heavy lifting)

### A/B test ideas

1. **Quick score vs. direct upload:** Does the zero-friction postcode path produce more completed scores than the bill upload path? Hypothesis: yes, by a wide margin. But upload users may convert to Energy Communities at a higher rate.
2. **Tier label language:** Danish-only labels vs. bilingual labels. Danish audience may share more with Danish-only labels (feels like an in-joke). Bilingual labels may perform better for broader reach.
3. **Hero approach:** "How screwed are you?" (confrontational) vs. "Where does your money go?" (curious). Test whether provocation or curiosity drives more score checks. Danish audiences may respond differently — dry humor lands, hard sells don't.
4. **Referred page minimal vs. context:** Test the ultra-minimal referred friend page against a version with one paragraph of context. Hypothesis: minimal wins for mobile, context wins for desktop.
5. **Ownership framing vs. savings framing:** Test the v4 "own the infrastructure" framing against a v3-style "save money" framing. If ownership outperforms savings in Denmark, it validates the cooperative-first positioning.

---

_Copy v4 — Structural rewrite. Key changes from v3: ownership-first framing replaces savings-first framing throughout. Killed "You become the provider" and all provider-switch language patterns. Removed standalone Differentiation section. Added institutional transparency section. Added concrete ownership example (school roof, shared battery). Acknowledged real effort and limitations honestly (renter regulation, startup costs, 6–12 month timeline). Removed urgency tactics, FOMO language, and "no sales pitch" disclaimers. Testimonial placeholders explicitly require real quotes. Production notes added for data verification. The copy now reads as a cooperative organizing tool, not a comparison site._
